## Alice is driving to work

Alice, a 21 year old, is driving
to work in the morning, a 20 minute 
comute.

Alice wants to learn about clouds.

### Dialogue between Alice and the app

Alice: Hey Erudite, I would like to learn about clouds.

Erudite: Clouds are tiny water 
droplets or ice crystals floating in 
the air. They form when the air is 
warm and moist and cools down or when 
it gets more water vapor from a nearby 
source. Clouds are found in the 
troposphere, stratosphere, and 
mesosphere.
